# Interactive LED Strip (Microcontroller)
This folder contains the code for the Microcontroller side of the code. This code is for a MicroPython device, I am using a D1 Mini personally but any board would work.

## Configuration
`config.py` contains all of the configuration so that the code can be copied easily and only the configuration needs to be changed out.
